    <p class="mt-3 text-sm">The choice of the name "Amata" for our meditation center, officially known as the Amata Meditation
        Center (AMC), is deeply rooted in the core principles and aspirations of our center. The name "Amata" holds
        profound significance in the context of Buddhist ideals, reflecting our dedication to the study and practice of
        higher virtues, higher mind, and higher wisdom as advocated by the Buddha.</p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm">The term "Amata" is derived from the Pali language and directly translates to "deathless." This
        concept is intricately connected to the ultimate goal of Buddhist practitioners – the attainment of Nibbāna, a
        state beyond birth, decay, and death. The renowned Indian Buddhist monk, commentator, and philosopher
        Buddhaghosa, who lived in the 5th century, eloquently articulated this aspiration with the phrase <i>"na jāyati na
        jīyati na mīyati ti amatan ti vuccati"</i> - meaning, "Not to be reborn, not to decay, not to die is said to be
        Amata."</p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm">By choosing the name "Amata" for our center, we emphasize the essence of our commitment to guiding
        individuals towards the pursuit of the deathless state, Nibbāna. This encapsulates the core philosophy of our
        meditation center and underscores the transformative journey that practitioners undertake within our community.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm">At the heart of all AMC activities lies the dual emphasis on meditative practice, specifically
        samatha-vipassanā, and theoretical learning of the Buddha's teachings. We embrace a non-sectarian approach,
        fostering an inclusive environment where individuals from various backgrounds can engage in the profound
        exploration of Buddhist wisdom and the cultivation of a tranquil mind.</p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm">In essence, "Amata" serves not just as a name but as a symbolic representation of our meditation
        center's commitment to guiding individuals on a path towards the timeless and liberating essence of Nibbāna,
        embodying the teachings of the Buddha in a manner that transcends sectarian boundaries.</p>
